## Assets:
- Apart from the music which is downloaded from dig.ccmixter.com or freesound.org, most of the assets are made by me using blender and photoshop.
- The grass texture is downloaded from the internet.
- This game is made following instructions from the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-2020-android-game-development-create-a-complete-game/ making any necessary tweeaks in the code that felt much better for the assets in hand or changing the code for a more updated version.
- The animations for the character are downloaded from mixamo.com after uploading my final character.
- The created character and the idea of the cube world is taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFbQZSpSG_Y&ab_channel=CGBoost
